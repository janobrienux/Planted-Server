            Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the 
            yard and you'll be working by yourself.
             Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. 
             These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
             It is a lot of fun. Look at them little rascals.
